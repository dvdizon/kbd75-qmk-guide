The QMK firmware docs should be looked at instead: https://docs.qmk.fm/#/

TL;DR:

- Go to https://config.qmk.fm/ and load your keyboard and change the layout to your liking
- Click the "Compile" button in the top right
- This will take a minute, but you should eventually be able to click the "Firmware" button to download a .hex file
- Download QMK toolbox from here: https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases
- Open the .hex file from above
- Follow the steps here to put your keyboard into bootloader mode: https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_flashing
- You should see some yellow text in QMK toolbox
- Click the "Flash" button
- Done ðŸ˜ƒ
